## Project Overview
The **TER Stock Analysis Dashboard** provides an intuitive and interactive way to explore historical data and gain insights into the performance of Teradyne, Inc. (TER) stock. With built-in features for visualizing trends, trading volume, volatility, and future price predictions, this dashboard serves as a powerful tool for both novice and experienced investors.

**Purpose**: The primary objective is to use historical stock data to analyze patterns and trends, predict future prices using an LSTM model, and present findings through an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

## Features
- **Historical Stock Price Analysis**: Visualize closing prices, moving averages (20-day and 50-day), and trading volume.
- **Volatility Analysis**: Calculate and display 30-day annualized volatility to understand stock risk.
- **LSTM-Based Price Predictions**: Forecast future stock prices using an LSTM model for a user-selected period.
- **Interactive Date Range Selection**: Customize the analysis by selecting specific date ranges.
- **Dynamic Forecast Periods**: Change the forecast duration between 30 and 180 days.
- **User-Friendly Dashboard**: An interactive Streamlit interface for easy exploration and analysis.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`
- **Machine Learning Framework**: `tensorflow` (LSTM Model)
- **Data Visualization**: `matplotlib`, `streamlit`
- **Data Source**: `yfinance` (Yahoo Finance API)

## Installation and Setup
### Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ter_stock_analysis.git
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd ter_stock_analysis
3. **Install the Required Libraries**: Install all the necessary dependencies using the requirements.txt file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
4. **Run the Streamlit Dashboard**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the Streamlit dashboard using the command
   ```bash
   streamlit run ter_stock_dashboard.py
5. **View the Dashboard**: After running the command above, open your browser and go to

**How to Use the Dashboard**
Once the dashboard is up and running, you can use it as follows:

Select the Date Range:

Use the sidebar on the left to select the start and end dates for the analysis.
The dashboard will automatically update the visualizations based on the selected date range.
Set the Forecast Period:

Choose the number of days to forecast future prices. The forecast period can be set between 30 days and 180 days.
Explore Visualizations:

Historical Prices and Moving Averages: View the historical stock prices along with 20-day and 50-day moving averages.
Trading Volume Analysis: Observe the trading volume to see how active the stock is over different periods.
Volatility Analysis: Check the 30-day annualized volatility to understand the risk associated with the stock.
View Future Price Predictions:

See the Predicted Price graph to analyze the LSTM modelâ€™s forecast for the future stock prices.
Interact with the graph by hovering over data points to explore different segments of the predicted data.
**Model and Analysis Summary**

1. LSTM Model for Time Series Forecasting:
The LSTM model was trained using a 60-day lookback period on normalized stock prices.
The model captures sequential patterns and dependencies in the data, allowing for accurate short-term price forecasting.
2. Volatility Analysis:
High volatility indicates higher risk, while lower volatility suggests stable stock behavior.
TER stock shows moderate volatility over the analyzed period.
3. Cumulative Returns:
Cumulative returns provide a long-term view of the stockâ€™s performance.
These returns are calculated based on daily price movements, reflecting the stockâ€™s growth over time.
